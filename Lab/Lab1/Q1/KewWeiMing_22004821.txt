My name is KEW WEI MING with matrix number, 22004821. I am
majoring in COMPUTER SYSTEM AND NETWROKING. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because there is a lot of things which I never know before.

I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will try hard and study hard. Wish me luck!!!
