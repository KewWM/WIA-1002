3. What is a raw type? Why is a raw type unsafe? Why is the raw type allowed in Java?
Ans: 
Raw type is a generic class or interface used without specifying a concrete type or without a type parameter.
Raw type unsafe because it allow mixed type of parameters which leads to runtime errors.
Raw type is allowed because of the purpose of backward compatibility with pre-Java 5 code and to make it save, generic type is used.

4. What is erasure? Why are Java generics implements using erasure?
Ans:
Erasure is the process by which the Java compiler replaces a generic type with its non-generic equivalent at compile time. 
The reason Java generics are implemented using erasure is to maintain backward compatibility with pre-Java 5 code.
