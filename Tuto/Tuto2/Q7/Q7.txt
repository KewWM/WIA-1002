Assume that the following objects were created
ArrayList<String> vehicle = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Object> transportation = new ArrayList<>();

Declare a method header for generic method,allTransportation 
that returns nothing,which accepts two ArrayList parameters using the wildcards.

Ans:
public static void allATransportation (ArrayList<?> l1, ArrayList<?> l2)
{

}
