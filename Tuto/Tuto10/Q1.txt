Compare between linear search and binary search algorithms 
by searching for the numbers 45 and 54 in the following list :

                    3  8  12  34  54  85  61  110

For number 45:

Linear Search: 
Linear search algorithm will iterate from index 0 until last index and return -1 
because up until the last index 45 is not found. Number of iterations is 8.

Binary Search:
Binary search algorithm will take the middle element 54 as pivot point and
found that it is larger than 45, so the high will be set to element 34 and 
the mid will be set to 8, then because the mid is less than 45 so the low will be set to 12 and 
the mid will also be 12, then the high will become smaller than low and the search returns -1 as element is not found. 
Number of iterations is 3.


For number 54:

Linear Search:
Linear search algorithm will iterate from index 0 until index 4 and return 54.
Number of iterations is 5.

Binary Search:
Binary search algorithm for this case will take the middle element 54 as a pivot point and 
immediately return the middle index because this element is exactly the element to be searched. 
Number of iteration is 1.
