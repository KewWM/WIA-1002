Provide and explain three operations / functions of Linked List based Queue that you can add to the GenericQueue class, 
other than those discussed in the lecture (i.e., enqueue, dequeue and getSize â€“ from Slide 10 in the lecture slide).

Ans:
The first operation that can be added is the peek() method, 
where it returns the first element in the queue without actually removing it.

The second operation that can be added is the isEmpty() method, 
where it returns a boolean value to check if the queue is empty.

The third operation that can be added is the clear() method, 
where it clears the queue by setting the head and the tail pointer towards null.
